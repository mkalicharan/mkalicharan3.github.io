# The Clarity-First Approach to Career Decisions

We're often told to "just do it" and take action. But in career decisions, acting without clarity can lead us in circles—or worse, in the wrong direction entirely.

## The Action-Without-Clarity Trap

I've spoken with hundreds of professionals who rushed into career changes only to find themselves in a similar situation a year later. The pattern is familiar:

- Feel stuck or unfulfilled
- See others making moves
- Feel pressure to act quickly
- Jump at the first opportunity
- End up in a similar but different situation

This cycle repeats because the underlying issues weren't addressed. Action was taken, but clarity was missing.

## What Does Career Clarity Actually Mean?

Clarity isn't about having a perfect 10-year plan. It's about understanding:

1. **Your values**: What truly matters to you in work and life?
2. **Your strengths**: What do you do better than most people?
3. **Your constraints**: What are your non-negotiables?

When these three align, decisions become easier because you're not guessing—you're choosing from a position of understanding.

## A Simple Clarity Framework

Before your next career decision, try this:

### Step 1: The Anti-Resume List
Write down everything you've done that you hated. Be specific about what made each experience unpleasant. This reveals your anti-patterns—things to avoid.

### Step 2: The Flow State Audit
List times you were deeply engaged in work, where time disappeared. What were you doing? What conditions made this possible?

### Step 3: The Three-Year Letter
Write a letter from your future self, three years from now, describing your ideal work life. Don't worry about "realistic"—this is about aspiration.

## The Investment Pays Off

Spending time on clarity feels slow compared to taking action. But consider: how many weeks or months of your life have been spent on paths that weren't right for you?

Clarity work is an investment. It pays dividends in every subsequent decision.

## Starting Small

You don't need a week-long retreat to gain clarity. Start with 30 minutes:

- Take the anti-resume list exercise
- Reflect on your patterns
- Have one conversation with someone who knows you well

Small insights compound.
